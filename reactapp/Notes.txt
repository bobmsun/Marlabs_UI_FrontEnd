npx create-react-app reactapp           -- want to run something without install it



Why React?

Angular - is a framework - framework is quite heavy
React - is a liabrary

React is created for rendering DOM faster
操作 DOM 是一个非常 expensive 的操作, update of DOM is very expensive, will make web app slower

(DOM - Document Object Model)


How React is faster than regular DOM updatation?
React uses virtual DOM. 
React creates a copy of the DOM, which is known as the virtual DOM.
React will compare to see which part of the view is change. Only the changed part will be update to avoid reloading the entire page.

So React scales better than Angular, faster than Angular

React is only used for UI
因为 React is just a library, 所以 想用 Routing/ make http calls,
需要 needs to install separate packages out of the box

React component can be created either by a class or a function

3年前，class 有 state，function 没有
现在
Whatever class can do, now function can do with the help of hooks
hooks are separate functions I can use to get the feature of class component


npx 和 npm command 是 我们在 安装 node environment 时跟着安装的


For class component, you need to have a render function

之前学过 bind, call, apply 这3种 redirect the this pointer 的方法

必须要 export，才能在其他 file 中 import

hooks are basically functions
hooks allow you to have state management inside functional component


setState is Asynchronous
Alos have an option to write a callback function

React 的 pulg-in:
rce - create a class component
rounst - create constructor

接下来学：
Redux, Flux
